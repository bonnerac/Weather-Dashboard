## To Use

Simply type the name of a city in the searchbar. The Weather Dashboard will provide you with lots of information about the current and future weather conditions of that city. Previous cities that you searched for will appear on the left side of the screen.

## Goals

This site is designed to take a city input from the user and display weather information about the selected city. The information includes:

* City Name and current weather icon
* Local Time
* Temperature 
* Humidity
* UV Index with dynamically generated colors for index level
* 5 day forecast featuring dynamically generated date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity.
* A search history


## Complications

During the process of making this planner site, I did run into some problems: 

* Writing DRY code.
    * I got almost all of the elements on the page that I wanted, but I still feel like I was repeating myself a lot and could have used more for loops to cut down on my overall lines of code.
* Local storage
    * Although I was able to store what I wanted to in local storage, I was unable to make the search history reappear after refresh. I also was unable to put each city name in its own seperate div, which would have made for a more asthetically pleasing and effective page design.

## Credits and Thanks

Thank to Paul for trying to guide me through my local storage problems.

# Weather-Dashboard


## Desciption
A weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Goals

This site is designed to take a city input from the user and display weather information about the selected city. The information includes:

* City Name and current weather icon
* Local Time
* Temperature 
* Humidity
* UV Index with dynamically generated colors for index level
* 5 day forecast featuring dynamically generated date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity.
* A search history


## Complications

During the process of making this planner site, I did run into some problems: 

* Writing DRY code.
    * I got almost all of the elements on the page that I wanted, but I still feel like I was repeating myself a lot and could have used more for loops to cut down on my overall lines of code.
* Local storage
    * Although I was able to store what I wanted to in local storage, I was unable to make the search history reappear after refresh. I also was unable to put each city name in its own seperate div, which would have made for a more asthetically pleasing and effective page design.

## Credits and Thanks

Thank to Paul for trying to guide me through my local storage problems.
